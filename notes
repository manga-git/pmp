PMP Notes:

> Definition of a Project:
	- temporary
	- has a beginning and an end
	- creates an unique product, service or result.
	
> Project management Process groups:
	- Initiating
	- Planning
	- executing
	- Monitoring
	- Controlling
	- Closing

	>> Idiotic Plastic Explorers Manhandled Colorful Cabbages<<
	
> Project management Knowledge Areas:
	- Integration
	- Scope
	- Time
	- Cost
	- Quality
	- Human Resource
	- Communications
	- Risk
	- Procurement
	- Stakeholder

> Each Knowledge Area is made up of processes.

> Difference between Knowledge Areas and Process Groups:

	Knowledge Areas cover what you need to KNOW.
	Process Groups cover what you need to DO.

> Definition of a Program:
	- group of related projects
	- 

> A Portfolio has:
	- group of programs
	- individual projects
	- operational work
	- all 3 above are grouped together AND prioritized for a strategic goal

> ORGANIZATIONAL Project Management (OPM):
	- a framework for HOW projects, portfolios, & org work should be done to meet the org's strategic goals.

> OPM3: 
	- OPM3 is PMI's organizational project maturity model.
	- helps orgs determine their level of maturity in project management.

> PMO
	- centralizes and standardizes management of projects in an organization.
	- types of PMO:
		- Supportive PMO
			- provides support & guidance in the form of policies, templates, methodologies, lessons learned.
			- low control over projects.

		- Controlling PMO
			- provides support & guidance as above
			- provides training in project management and tools
			- ensures compliance to organizational PM practices.
			- moderate control

		- Directive PMO
			- provides PMs for projects
			- is responsible for the results of projects
			- high level of control over projects.
			- 
	- For PMP exam, assume:
		- there is a PMO
		- determine which of the 3 types the PMO is

> Constraints
	- include: scope, time, costs, resources, quality, risk, & customer satisfaction

	- help evaluate conflicting demands
	- should be prioritized

> Stakeholder:
	- any person or org that will be affected +vely or -vely by the outcome of the project.
	- should be:
		- kept informed, 
		- inputs solicited, 
		- needs and expectations satisfied.

> Organizational Structure
	- Functional
		- company is organized by departments/silos
		- projects occur within a department
		- team members complete project work, in addition to departmental work.

	- Projectized
		- company organized by projects
		- team members have no home/department after completing a project
		- communication happens within the prject.

	- Matrix
		- team reports to two bosses - project manager and functional manager
		- communication goes from team members to both bosses
		- team members do project work, in addition to departmental work.
		- Strong matrix - power is with project manager
		- Weak matrix - power is with functional manager. Project manager role is like coordinator/expediter.
		- Balanced matrix - power is balanced between both
		- "Tight" matrix - a colocated team

	- For PMP exam, assume org is a Matrix org.

> PM types in a WEAK matrix (ONLY in a functional org)
	- Project Expediter
		- is like an assistant and communications coordinator. Keeps traack of status and reports it.
		- does not make or enforce decisions

	- Project Coordinator
		- has some more powers - makes and enforces decisions.

> Enterprise environmental factors: company culture and existing systems/baggage.

> PMIS - Project Management Information Systems
	- includes tools like
		- scheduling software, work authorization software, time-tracking software, procurement management software
		- repositories for historical info

	- PMIS are part of a company's enterprise enivronmental factors/company culture

> Organizational Process Assets
	- processes, procedures, historical info
	- provide direction, guidance to benefit from past experience
	- For PMP, assume these assets are available

> Lessons learned (post-mortem)
	- what went right, went wrong, what can be done better
	- should cover 3 areas:
		- technical aspects of the project
		- project management
		- management
	
	- documenting lessons learned is a required practice for PMP

> 3 stages of PM info generation:
	- Work Performance data: info gathered during project execution
	- Performance Information: info gathered during project controlling phase
	- Reports: performance information gathered into performance reports

> Project Life Cycle (PLC) & Project Mgmt Process (PMP) - Diffs:
	- PLC: what you need to DO the work. PMP: what you need to MANAGE the work.
	- PLC can be plan-driven projects like waterfall projects, or change-driven like agile projects.
	- PMP includes the 5 process groups (plastic explorers - colorful cabbages!)

================================================================
> As a PM you should understand why the project was selected:
	- to enter a new market?
	- to meet a governance expectation or regulatory requirement?
	- pet project of some senior exec?
	- customer request?
	- intangible objective like improve company's image?

> The 5 process groups basically map to: start, plan, do, check, close.

> Integration Process Group:
	- Outputs of this process group: Project Charter and Stakeholder Registry.

> Progressive Elaboration: process of continously refining estimates and scope.

> Planning Process Group:
	- Outputs: Project Management Plan and project documents that will guide execution of the project.	
	- Rolling wave planning: Planning for the next phase as when current phase nears completion.
	- Inputs from ALL stakeholders are used to create the project plan.

> Executing Process Group:
	- PM basically has a guiding, proactive role during this phase, always referring to project plan & project docs.
